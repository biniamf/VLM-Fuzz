Given the screenshot of an app with interactive UI elements labeled with numbers, provide an analysis and interaction strategy using the following functions to interact with the app:

1. tap(element: int): Taps the specified UI element by its numeric label.
2. long_press(element: int): Long presses the specified UI element by its numeric label.
3. swipe(element: int, direction: str, dist: str): Swipes on the specified UI element in the given direction (up, down, left, right) for a given distance (short, medium, long).
4. input(element: int, text_input: str): Inputs text into the specified text box by its numeric label.
5. tap(BACK): Performs the BACK action.
6. tap(ENTER): Performs the ENTER action.
7. scroll(UP): Scrolls up the screen.
8. scroll(DOWN): Scrolls down the screen.

The response should be structured as follows each on a single line:

Observation: <Describe the app's interface, noting any clickable links, text fields, or other interactive elements, along with their respective labels.>
Thought: <Identify the primary action to take within the app based on the labeled elements.>
Steps: <Outline a sequence of interactions using the provided functions, such as tapping, inputting text, or scrolling. You cannot output anything else except a function call in this field. Example output: Steps: [tap(5); input(5, "Buy groceries"); tap(3);]>
Summary: <Summarize the interaction performed.>

The labels in this screenshot are [<labels>].

Your past actions to proceed with this task are summarized as follows: You did not perform other action before.
Now, given the following labeled screenshot, you need to think and call the function needed to proceed with the task. 
If there are multiple text input boxes, provide an input for each of them in your response by calling the input() function multiple times.
Make sure the action is performed on the right label.
Make sure you include action for all the labelled items.

For example, if the screenshot is of a to-do list app, the response might look like this:

Observation: The screen shows a list of tasks with checkboxes beside them. There is an 'Add Task' button labeled 3 and a text input field for the new task labeled 5.
Thought: To add a new task, I should first tap the text input field labeled 5, enter the task, and then tap the 'Add Task' button labeled 3.
Steps: [tap(5); input(5, "Buy groceries"); tap(3);]
Summary: I entered "Buy groceries" into the text input field and tapped the 'Add Task' button to add it to the list.
